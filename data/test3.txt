            I am very pleased with the progress on the project. I am learning a great deal from your code and am happy to pass along the knowledge you've shared to others. 
            
            Warmly,

            Good day friend,
            
            I am so glad it is working out. We should all meet up before the end of the year to celebrate! 
            
            Best regards,
            
            Jake
